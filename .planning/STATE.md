## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Replace frame-step presets with fixed second jumps (seconds more intuitive for film review)
- Phase 1: Single layout for mobile and desktop (simpler to maintain, film clicker layout works at all sizes)
- Phase 2: Slow-mo toggle instead of speed dropdown (faster to switch during review)
- Phase 2: Configurable forward/rewind speed multiplier (different tasks need different scrub speeds)
