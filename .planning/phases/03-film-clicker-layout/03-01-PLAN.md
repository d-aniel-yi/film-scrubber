<objective>
Reorganize ControlBar into film clicker layout with clear visual hierarchy: seek bar → play/toggle row → hold buttons row → jump buttons row. Buttons span full width on mobile for easy tapping.

Purpose: Film clicker controls follow a predictable spatial hierarchy that matches muscle memory from film editing tools — most frequent actions (play/pause, slow-mo toggle) at top, scrubbing in middle, fine control (jumps) below.

Output: Reorganized ControlBar component with stacked row layout and full-width mobile buttons.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Reorganize ControlBar into stacked row layout</name>
  <files>src/components/ControlBar.tsx</files>
  <action>
Restructure the ControlBar JSX to follow film clicker hierarchy:

1. **Seek bar row** (already at top) — keep current structure
2. **Play/toggle row** — group Play/Pause + Slow-Mo toggle + timestamp + volume in one flex row
3. **Hold buttons row** — group Rewind + Forward buttons (slow speed) in their own row with full-width on mobile
4. **Hold buttons row (fast)** — group Fast Rewind + Fast Forward buttons in their own row with full-width on mobile
5. **Jump buttons row** — group all -/+ jump pairs in one row with proper spacing
6. **Settings inputs row** — scrub speed input remains at bottom for now

Use Tailwind layout utilities:
- Wrap button groups in divs with `flex w-full gap-2` for mobile full-width behavior
- Use `sm:w-auto` to let buttons shrink to content width on desktop
- Use `flex-1` on buttons within mobile rows so they span equal width
- Add `mb-2` or `mb-3` between major rows for visual separation

Maintain all existing button functionality, classes for touch behavior, and state-dependent styling. Only reorganize the JSX structure and adjust layout classes.

  <verify>
1. Load app in browser at mobile viewport (375px width)
2. Verify buttons are stacked in rows: seek bar → play/toggle → hold (slow) → hold (fast) → jumps → settings
3. Verify buttons span full width on mobile (flex-1 working)
4. Resize to desktop viewport (1024px+)
5. Verify buttons shrink to comfortable width on desktop (sm:w-auto working)
  </verify>
  <done>
ControlBar uses stacked row layout matching film clicker hierarchy. Buttons span full width on mobile and comfortable width on desktop. All existing functionality preserved.
  </done>

## Visual Layout Check
1. Mobile (375px): Buttons stacked in correct order and spanning full width
2. Desktop (1024px+): Buttons in comfortable widths with proper spacing
3. All button interactions still work (play, toggle, hold, jump)
4. Visual feedback (press states, hold states) still functional
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- LAYOUT-01 implemented: Control bar uses stacked row layout (seek bar → play/toggle → hold → jump → settings)
- LAYOUT-02 implemented: Buttons span full width on mobile screens
- No functionality regression: all buttons still work as before
- Touch feedback and hold states preserved
</success_criteria>
